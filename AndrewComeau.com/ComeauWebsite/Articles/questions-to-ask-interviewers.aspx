        <span class="articletitle">Surviving the Programming Interview</span><br />
        <span class="articlesub">&quot;Do you have any questions for us?&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        For some people, that's the most challenging question in a 
        job interview. They might spend a lot of time preparing a resume and 
        anticipating the interviewer's questions but thinking of questions to ask&nbsp; in return gets the least attention. Some people don't even see the 
        point when they're just hoping to get the job so they can start paying bills 
        again.</p>
    <p>
        Still, the questions that you ask tell the interviewer a 
        lot about you as a potential employee, especially your level of interest in 
        working for the company rather than just collecting a paycheck. When a potential 
        employee has no questions about the company at the end of the interview, he or 
        she can appear lazy or apathetic which are never desirable traits in an 
        employee.

    <p>
        My focus here is on programming interviews and, as with 
        any professional position, it's important to find out as much as you can about a 
        company at which you might be working for a few years. That company will have a 
        place on your resume and can impact the future of your career. The right 
        questions will also demonstrate your knowledge and perspective on the field of 
        software development and that you take the time to do research before making a 
        decision. This demonstrates an intelligence and analytical skill that companies 
        like to see in their employees, especially when they're paying the person a 
        programmer's salary.</p>
    <p>
        Many of the questions here are based on my 
        experience in various programming positions. If you're just starting out in the 
        field, some of them might not mean much to you and it's best to stick with the ones 
        that you understand so that you can make use of the answers. When I'm preparing 
        for an interview, I'll go through my master list which has about 25 questions on 
        various areas and select several of them based on the position. Obviously, I 
        don't want to go in there with 20 questions that would take up the interviewer's 
        afternoon but I do want to have six or seven good ones that will provide useful 
        information and demonstrate the fact that I've thought about the position.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        As you work in different jobs, you will also be able to 
        generate questions based on your own experience. It's good to maintain this list 
        just as you would maintain your resume. You might be able to get the answers to 
        many of them by researching the company through their website or other resources 
        prior to the interview. This is important as some interviewers will ask you what 
        you know about their company. Walking into the interview already informed on 
        things such as the history of the company, its products or major projects and 
        maybe even its investor information is a 
        big plus.</p>
    <p>
        When asking questions, it's important to treat it like a 
        conversation, not a checklist of items to be ticked off. Pay close attention to 
        the interviewer's answers so you can follow up on things they say with 
        additional questions that you might not have thought of beforehand. After all, 
        the purpose of asking these questions is mainly to learn about the company and 
        what you&#39;ll be facing if you actually work there. You might even find out that 
        you don&#39;t really want to! </p>
    <p>
        So, with all of that in mind, here are some of my 
        suggestions for things to ask on your next interview.</p>

            <p class="indent">
                <strong><em>What are some of the applications I might specifically be 
                working on? How are the applications distributed throughout the business?</em></strong></p>


            <p class="indent">
                <strong><em>Is there any unofficial programming being done outside of 
                I.T.? What is the department / company policy regarding 
                I.T. support of these programs?</em></strong></p>


    <p>
        If you're interviewing with a web design company that has 
        a lot of different customers or a company that produces software to sell, the 
        answers to these might be obvious. On the other hand, you might be pursuing a 
        job in a corporate environment like a bank or insurance agency where there's a 
        mix of software being designed for both the core business functions and support 
        departments throughout the company. Even when you do know, it's good to ask what 
        you'll be working on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The question about unofficial development might be 
        relevant, too. I started my programming career outside of I.T. putting together 
        applications with Microsoft Access, first for myself and then for people who 
        noticed what I could do. I've seen other people doing the same. When these 
        people leave the organization, someone often has to support the work they leave 
        behind. The answers to these questions might add to your sense of the place of 
        I.T. within the organization as well as what your job will involve.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What is the process for requesting a new application or 
                enhancement from I.T.?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How formalized are the requirements and specification 
                documents? Who writes them?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How are project timelines decided between the customers 
                and development team?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How are bug fixes and enhancements categorized within the 
                system? By risk? Severity? What kind of bug-tracking software is used?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What is I.T.&#39;s position within the company? How well does 
                it interact with the rest of the company?</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        The answers to these questions will eventually affect your job. Sometimes, 
        programmers and developers end up doing a lot more than programming. A software 
        developer&#39;s job can include gathering business requirements and writing 
        specifications while some companies have additional groups devoted to this such 
        as business analysts and technical writers. The question of project timelines 
        and scheduling of fixes to existing applications can give you an additional 
        sense of what your average day will be like. It&#39;s also very good to know how 
        project requirements will be communicated to you as the programmer and knowing 
        what kind of specification documents exist helps.</p>
    <p>
        Finally, if you're applying to a company in which I.T. is 
        only one department within a larger organization, the question of how I.T. 
        interacts with the rest of the company is almost always relevant. These 
        relationships can be very positive or they can be fairly toxic. Either way, it 
        will affect the quality of your job as you will likely have to interact with 
        these other departments. Of course, if the relationship isn't very good, you 
        probably won't get an honest answer from the interviewer but it's up to you to 
        look for clues in wording and answers to other questions that might indicate 
        this.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Are the programmers allowed or encouraged to independently 
                develop utilities for I.T. use?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Are programmers able to independently review code and 
                initiate change requests for the purposes of code-cleanup and continuous 
                improvement?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What kind of educational resources are available to 
                developers?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>If hired here, will I have to sign an intellectual 
                property agreement? If so, does it apply to any projects that I work on outside 
                the company?</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        One thing programming interviewers like to see is 
        enthusiasm for programming itself and effective use of free time. Although some 
        programming departments can have very little free time, others might have a 
        decent amount and a developer who will use that time to look for ways to improve 
        his or her own skills, the company's code base or their efficiency on future 
        projects is much more valuable than one who hangs out on YouTube. On the first 
        formal development team I was a part of, we used our free time to develop a 
        number of utilities that came in very handy when analyzing company data to track 
        down software issues. In the process, we increased our own efficiency and 
        expanded our skills.</p>
    <p>
        As for the intellectual property agreements, I read over 
        every one that I sign very carefully. There are some companies that try to lay 
        claim to ALL of an employee's work, on and off the job. It's important to know 
        what you're signing. Letting an interviewer know that you do have side projects 
        that you care about does an extra bit to establish your experience and your love 
        of programming. 
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Does the department have a documented set of coding 
                standards? </em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Is there a department library or other type of reference 
                collection?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What kind of help files or user documentation is included 
                with the applications?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What type of internal I.T. documentation or release 
                history is maintained on the applications and code?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Are formalized deployment instructions maintained for the 
                applications?</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        How good 
        is the company at maintaining documentation? Often the answer will be something 
        like “We do have SOME and we've been meaning to update it.” or “Well, it depends 
        on the program.”. If you're one of those rare programmers who actually likes to 
        write documentation, you might follow these questions up by mentioning 
        documentation that you've produced for a previous job.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Is there a system of peer review for finished code?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How proactive is the quality system? Is there a formal 
                corrective action system?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Is there a separate Q.A. department or do programmers 
                perform quality testing in addition to development? Are there formalized test 
                procedures or software in place?</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        Some concern for the quality of the software that you 
        produce and the related resources that the company provides is a very good sign 
        to a prospective employer. Knowing how testing and software failures are handled 
        within the company is also very relevant to your daily job as a programmer.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How is the expertise on different applications divided 
                within the development team? Are programmers experts on specific applications or 
                is there a focus on cross-training?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Is there any form of mentoring?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>On average, how long does it take for a new programmer to 
                become productive here?</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        Some companies have go-to people for specific applications 
        while others have a high degree of cross-training. Knowing how this is done at 
        the company, especially if you'll be responsible for any kind of on call 
        support, is important. Asking if there is a mentor program in place and about 
        the time it takes for the average programmer to train in that specific company 
        is another way to gauge the training environment and expectations the company 
        has for its employees. I've heard companies give estimates of anywhere from one to 
        six months for a programmer to become familiar and productive with the existing 
        software applications they'd be supporting.</p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How much overtime is expected / required on average?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>How many projects can I expect to be working on at any 
                given time?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Are the programmers on call for application support? How 
                is this divided up?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>Are programmers able to dial-in or otherwise do remote 
                access? Is telecommuting available?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>May I see the work area?</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        Do not be afraid to ask about overtime, especially if you 
        will be working on salary and you don't get paid for it! Wanting a decent work / 
        life balance does not make you lazy and some companies will exploit a 
        programmer's salaried status to get as much time as they can. You will also want 
        to know if you'll be required to carry a company cell phone or laptop for 
        on call support. Asking about the project load is important. If the company 
        offers 
        flexible hours, it might be hard for the interviewer to answer a direct question 
        about overtime but the number of projects you'll be expected to carry is another 
        way to find out what impact the job will have on you personally. A position 
        where you'll routinely be bouncing between three or four projects, each with a 
        deadline, and providing continuing support on past projects can also be 
        particularly difficult and this is something you should be aware of going in.</p>
    <p>
        Ideally, you'll get a tour of the work area as part of the 
        interview but this is not always possible. Going into a programming job that 
        requires a good deal of code writing and mental concentration when you haven't 
        seen the work area can result in some unpleasant surprises as programmers and 
        other I.T. employees sometimes receive the least consideration when it comes to 
        workspace.</p>
    <p>
        Finally ...</p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What are some of the long-term company / I.T. goals?</em></strong></p>
    <p class="indent">
        <strong><em>What is the best thing about working at this company in 
                comparison to other companies you've worked for.</em></strong></p>
    <p>
        These sound like pretty soft questions but they express an 
        interest in the company and indicate that you are thinking long-term rather than 
        just until your next paycheck. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that as an interviewer is answering these 
        questions, you should be reading between the lines and paying attention to how 
        they say things. The second question is actually a 
        diplomatic way of asking “What's the best reason for me to come to work here?”. 
        That's a question I&#39;ve actually asked bluntly of a couple of interviewers. One interviewer answered equally as bluntly; “You need to eat, 
        right?” We had a good laugh, the team gave some more serious answers and I was 
        eventually hired. As I've said, you probably won't get incredibly candid answers 
        to these questions but a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the interviewer's part 
        or sincere and glowing descriptions of the management and the company's mission 
        can be telling. It's up to you to be the judge.</p>
    <p>
        I know this sounds like quite a bit of information to be 
        gathering during an interview process but with a little practice, you can get 
        the hang of it. As with other professional positions, the process for hiring a 
        software developer or other I.T. professional can actually involve multiple 
        interviews over the phone and in person so there's time to work with. Of course, 
        the quality and cooperation of the interviewers themselves varies and I've had 
        the occasional interviewer start to sound impatient after only two or three 
        questions. That's generally a bad sign.</p>
    <p>
        Maybe the most important benefit of asking the right 
        questions is the transformation of the interview process from that nerve wracking 
        examination experience that so many people are familiar with to a process of 
        give and take between two professionals. Knowing what you are looking for in a 
        position and the company at large can change your perception of yourself from 
        walking in with your hand out asking for a job to reaching out to a company with 
        which you want a relationship that will benefit you both.</p>
