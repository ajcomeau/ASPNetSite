        Microsoft Access Project Rescue</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
        Microsoft Access is a powerful tool for creating 
        basic software solutions 
        where needed and often at a fraction of the cost of packaged software. It can 
        make the difference between having the necessary functionality today and waiting 
        for an enterprise solution to be agreed upon and implemented. Unfortunately, 
        a common problem is that when the company Access expert moves on to 
        another job or is otherwise unavailable, he or she leaves behind one or more 
        databases holding a large amount of company data that still need to be 
        supported.</p>

        Since 1997,
        I&#39;ve been designing and supporting applications with Microsoft Access and other programming 
        tools. These applications have ranged from small, stop-gap solutions 
        to multi-user systems for fields as diverse as manufacturing, healthcare and 
        finance. With the perspective I&#39;ve gained since then as a professional programmer, I can 
        advise you on what projects will benefit from a Microsoft Access application and 
        when it&#39;s better to move to another technology. I also have particular experience with 
        application analysis which enables me to analyze and work with existing software 
        systems.&nbsp;</p>

        When you need a new data solution for your project or if you&#39;re trying to get 
        an existing Microsoft Access project back on track, I will be glad to provide 
        the experience to get it going in the right direction.</p>
