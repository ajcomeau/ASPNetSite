        Electronic Publishing and Promotion</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
        Kindle? Nook? HTML? The field of electronic publishing is still new with a lot 
        of technologies competing for the standard with even more opportunities for new 
        authors to see their names on the cover of a published work. Now it&#39;s easier 
        than ever for someone to be published without going through the frustrating 
        cycle of manuscript submissions and rejections.</p>

        While these advancements have cut into the power of the publishing house and put 
        more power in the hands of the writers, they also mean more responsibility for 
        the independent author who wants to be noticed by the public and hopefully make 
        some money at the same time. Consumers still expect a quality product and 
        professionalism will always count when the reader decides on the credibility of 
        an author. Promoting your work also takes time and a knowledge of the available 
        resources.</p>
