          of 1024 x 768 or greater.</p><h4>Installation Packages</h4>
        <p><span class="propertitle">Job Search Plus</span> has been  designed with Microsoft Access. For users 
        without Access, the program is packaged with the 
        <a title="Official page on Microsoft.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d9ae78d9-9dc6-4b38-9fa6-2c745a175aed&displaylang=en">
        Microsoft Office Access 2007 Runtime</a>. This is a free version of 
        Access that enables users to open databases and edit data without making design 
        changes. It is similar in concept to the Word or Powerpoint viewers except it allows for editing 
        of data within the Access file. <i>If you do not have Microsoft 
        Access installed on your system, this is the package you will need to download.</i></p>
        <p>For users 
        <i>with</i> Access 2002 or later, separate download packages are available which 
        do not include the Access Runtime.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="cautionnote">
        This program is not compatible with versions of Access <em>prior</em> to 
        Access 2002. <b>The</b> <b>Access Runtime

          Overview</h4>
        <p>
          <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/029-Icon.jpg" align="right" width="79" 
                height="85">You 
          can start <span class="propertitle">Job Search Plus</span> through either the 
            shortcut created by the installation or by opening the JobSearchPlus file located in the program directory. Depending on the 
          installation, the <span class="propertitle">Job Search Plus</span> program will load using  your 
          copy of Access 2007 or the Access Runtime.<h4>The Office Ribbon</h4>
        <p>In the Access 2007 edition, the traditional menus that you might be accustomed 
        to seeing at the top of the screen have been replaced by a control 
        ribbon that presents functions for easy accessibility. </p>

          <div class="fltcenter">
        <a title="Click for full-size image." target="_blank" href="../Graphics/jsplus/021-Ribbon.jpg">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/021-Ribbon-small.jpg" width="500" height="49"></a></a>
          </div>
		  
        <p>In this program, the menu ribbon includes standard controls such as 
        copy and paste functions as well as program-specific controls to open 
        reports and forms. You will see references to this ribbon 
        throughout the rest of this manual so it might help you now to take a 
        moment to get familiar with the options offered there.<p>In the Access 
        2002 edition of the program, a traditional menu system includes all the 
        functions featured on the 2007 edition's ribbon. &nbsp; 

        <h4>Job Leads Search List</h4>
        <p>
        <div class="fltright">
        <a target="_blank" title="Click for full-size image." href="../Graphics/jsplus/012-LeadsListing.jpg">
		<img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/012-LeadsListing-small.jpg" width="300" height="166"></a>
		</div>
		The program's central form is 
        the Job Leads Search List which, by default, lists all active job leads 
        you have entered. An active job lead is an opportunity that you are still 
        pursuing and have not  marked as closed. You will see how to change 
        this status later. This screen 
        also includes search functions which enable you to specify the leads 
         
        currently displayed and find specific leads based on date, 
        active status, company and location. 
  
        <p>The screenshot 
        above shows a copy of the program where leads 
        have already been entered. When you first open the program and do 
        not have any active leads, the program will prompt you after a couple seconds, asking if you 
        want to enter new ones. Selecting 'Yes' will open the Quick Entry screen 
        which will be explained  
        later.<p>The Search List screen has controls and visual aids to 
          guide you in using the program. If you hover the mouse over  
          parts of the screen, you will often see a control tip that will 
          give you further instructions. The following are a few of the 
          controls that you will find on this form.</p>

        you might need a quick way to record a job lead for later update. In 
        order to keep from overwhelming you with a lot of data entry, the Job 
        Lead Quick Entry screen records just the basic information. While a

        to the database, they will show up as selections in these fields.</p>
          
        <p>This form also has the following fields:<ul>
            <li><i>Job Location</i> - This field holds the actual location of the 
            position (i.e. city and state) which might differ from the company or contact addresses. 
            It's displayed on the Leads Search List for reference. Completing this field for leads 
            can be useful if you are searching in multiple cities or states. </li>
            <li><i>Employment Type</i> - You can use this field to indicate if 
            the job is full or part-time. It also includes options for 
            internships, freelance jobs and other types of employment.</li>
            <li><i>Company / Agency</i> - As many people use job placement agencies as 
            part of their search, the program enables you to enter both a 
            company and an agency for the lead. If you enter a company or 
            agency name in these fields that does not exist in the program, you 
            will be prompted to provide more information. 
            The company name is the only information required to save the record, however the program 
            will store full address information and 
            other details.</li>
            <li><i>Contact</i> - This field is intended to store the name of 
            your primary contact for the lead at either the company or the agency. The system will limit the names shown in the drop down to contacts 
            for the company and&nbsp; agency specified. If you enter a new 
            name that does not match any of the contacts entered for either company, 
            the system will prompt you to provide more information. A 
            first or last name as well as a company name is required to save a 
            contact in the database.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">Contacts in the database are always linked to 
            specific companies and cannot be saved without a company reference. 
            This is necessary to support the ability of the database to present 
            contact names based on companies. <br>
            <br>
            While some leads found online include contact e-mails with no 
            company names, these are often attempts to gather personal 
            information rather than true employment opportunities and should be 
            responded to with caution. <p>After you finish entering the information for a lead, you 
        can enter the next one by clicking
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Add New Lead</span> or go to the 
        detail screen for the current lead with
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Show Detail</span>. 
        <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Return</span> will save the lead 
        and return you to the Leads List screen.<h4>Job Lead Central</h4>
        <p>This screen is a one-stop resource 
          where you can view and update the information for a specific lead. It includes 
          all the information from the Quick Entry screen plus a few more items. </p>

        <div class="fltcenter">
        <a title="Click for full-size image." target="_blank" href="../Graphics/jsplus/008-LeadDetailFrame.jpg">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/008-LeadDetailFrame-small.jpg" width="300" height="186"></a>
        <p>Job Lead Central provides a single form with which to maintain all details on a lead.</p>
        </div>

		<p>A valuable feature on this form is the Activities entry where you can 
        record the history of your work on the lead from the initial inquiry and 
        application through the interview and correspondence. Activities 
        can be entered for future dates and marked as incomplete so the program 
        will prompt you when they are due to be completed. While the 
        activity date and type are the only required fields, the Details field 
        allows for plenty of information to be stored on the progress of the 
        lead.</p>

		<div class="fltcenter">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/030-JLCDataSelect.jpg" width="508" height="52">
        <p>Using the selection control, you can quickly view all the necessary details on the lead.</p>
        </div>
        
		<p>Job Lead Central organizes a great deal of information for quick 
        access. In addition to the activities, you can reference the 
        company, agency and contact information just by selecting the 
        appropriate option in the center of the screen as shown in the above 
        screenshot. The final option, 
        Related Leads, will present a list of active leads which have items such 
        as job title or company in common with the current lead. By double 
        clicking on one of these leads, you can easily pull up the detail for 
        that opportunity.</p>
        
        <p>
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/031-Attachments.jpg" align="left" width="159" height="145">The Lead Attachments control on the right side of the form
          enables you to store electronic documents specific to the lead. 
          This could include saved e-mails, job descriptions or electronic 
          applications. The control is capable of storing multiple 
          documents in a variety of formats including Word, PDF and graphic 
          formats such as JPG and BMP. 
        
            <p>With the Source field, you can record the source of the lead such 
            as an online job board or local newspaper. This feature might help you 
            to better use various sources and determine which ones are the most 
            productive. As with other fields, entering a new source will 
            cause the program to prompt you for any additional information you 
            want to enter for that source, such as the URL.</p>
		<p>The Active Lead option in the 
          bottom right-hand corner of the screen is used to mark a lead as 
        active or inactive. If you stop pursuing a lead because it's been 
        filled or for whatever other reason, you can use this option to close 
        the lead. It's also possible to reactivate a closed lead, if 
        necessary.<h4>Data Maintenance</h4>
        <p>
        Aside from job leads and activities, <span class="propertitle">Job Search Plus</span> stores supporting data including 
        company, contacts and resources. To provide you with a convenient 
        way to maintain and reference this information, the program includes a 
        Maintenance screen where you can quickly view and edit any of these 
        items. This screen is available from its icon on the menu ribbon.</p> 

		<div class="fltcenter">
		<img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/032-RefData.jpg" width="397" height="60">
		</div>
		
        <p>On the top of the maintenance form, the selector control enables you 
        to select which category of data you want to work with. The bottom 
        of the screen contains standard controls to add and edit data. As 
        with the Leads Search form, you can click on the column headers to sort 
        and double-click on an item to bring up the edit screen on which you 
        can enter more detail. </p> 
        
	
        <h4>Using the Program </h4>
        <h5>Entering New Leads</h5>
        <p>I mentioned earlier that if you 
        open the program when there are no active leads, you will be prompted 
        after a couple of seconds to enter new ones and choosing 'Yes' will open 
        the Quick Entry form. There are a few other ways to get to this 
        screen:<p>&nbsp;<div align="center">
          <center><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="600" id="AutoNumber1">

              <tr>

                <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Add New Lead</span> option which

          </center>
        </div>
          <p>With the exception of the Description field, all of the fields on 
          the Quick Entry form are drop-down fields which learn as you enter new 
          values. They also anticipate your entries and try to complete 
          what you're typing. For example, if you've previously entered 
          the job title of &quot;Office Manager&quot; for a lead, you will find that title 
          in the drop-down list for the Job Title field. Also, if you 
          type &quot;Off&quot; in that field, it will supply the first title it 
          finds with those three letters in front. You can accept this 
          value or continue typing to enter the correct value.<p>The Description 
          field is designed to store full job descriptions such as you might 
          copy from an online source. By right-clicking on the field and 
          choosing Paste from the pop-up menu or positioning the cursor in the 
          field and pressing Ctrl-V on your keyboard you can paste any amount of 
          text into this field for storage.<p>The Company, Agency and Contact 
          fields all represent items on which additional details can be entered 
          and are designed to prompt you for additional entry if you enter a new 
          value in one of them. This also guards against misspellings of 
          company or contact names that were previously entered. You can 
          also add new companies and contacts to the database by using the 
          options to the right of these fields.<p>After entering the desired 
          information in the Quick Entry screen, you can click Return to go back 
          to the Job Leads Listing or click Show Detail which will open the Job 
          Lead Central form and display the lead that you are currently 
          entering.<h5>Entering Activities 
          and Reminders</h5>
        <p>The ability to enter activities for job leads enables you to keep a 
        detailed history of your communication with a company on a specific 
        opportunity. The record of activities also serves to update the 
        Last Activity column on the main search screen. This helps you to 
        see which leads need attention and follow-up. </p>

        <div class="fltcenter">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/036-ActivityGrid.jpg" width="580" height="207">
        </div>

        <p>Activities can also serve 
          as reminders of actions that are needed on specific leads. If 
          you enter an activity with a future date and leave the Complete 
          checkbox unchecked as shown in the above example, the activity will be recognized by the program as 
          a reminder until the Complete checkbox is checked or the lead is made 
          inactive. When you start the program, it 
            will offer to display a list of leads on the Leads Search List with activities that have not 
            been completed for the current or prior dates.
        
            <p>You can enter activities two ways; either through the sub-form on 
            the Job Lead Central screen or by clicking on the Enter New Activity 
            option at the bottom of the screen. This will bring up the 
            Activity Edit screen which offers more room for editing and adds an 
            extra Reference Link field in case you want associate a URL with the 
            activity.</p>

        <div class="fltcenter">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/037-ActivityEdit.jpg" width="450" height="364">
        </div>
        
        <p>The Activity Date and Activity Type fields are the only 
          required fields to save an activity record.<h5>Working with Attachments</h5>
        <p>
        The Lead Attachments control on Job Lead Central makes it possible for 
        you to store electronic attachments such as correspondence and other 
        files related to a specific lead. This control is linked to a 
        special field in the database that stores multiple documents of various 
        types including graphics, Word and PDF files.</p>

        <div class="fltcenter">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/006-AttachmentAdd.jpg" width="300" height="176">
        </div>
        
        <p>By double-clicking on the Lead Attachments box, you can bring up a dialog 
        that will enable you to add, view or remove documents or save existing 
        documents outside of the database.<p class="note">As these documents are stored directly 
            in the database, storing multiple copies of the same document (i.e. 
            a resume) under different leads is not recommended. For 
        documents that are used often, consider storing them in a location on 
        your drive and using the Reference Link field under the lead Activities 
        to link to them.<h5>Managing Reference Data</h5>
        <p>As with job leads, there 
          are a few ways you can access the necessary screens to add or edit 
          companies,&nbsp; contacts and job lead sources.<p>&nbsp;<div align="center">

            displayed, you can use the commands at the bottom of the form to 
            edit the company or contact shown or enter a new one.</td>

            <p>Through the Maintenance form, you can also edit the list of 
            Business Types that can be used to define the companies that you 
            enter into the database. You can enter new types or edit 
            existing ones as needed. Just remember that when you edit a 
            business type description, it will be changed for any companies it's 
            been used with. 
            <h5>Contacts</h5>
            <p>When entering a contact into the database, 
            you must specify a company for that contact. This design is 
            based on the probability that most, if not all, contacts for a 
            legitimate employment offer will at least supply a company name. 
            Although there are job leads on the Internet and elsewhere 
            that only supply a contact name and e-mail for sending your resume, 
            many are 
            scams to build mailing lists.<p>If you do need to enter a contact 
        without a company, one way is to create a company by the 
        name of &quot;Unknown Company&quot; or something similar. (Again, only the company 
        name is required to save the record.)&nbsp; Then, all of these contacts 
        can be recorded under that company until, hopefully, you find out more 
        information. Remember that the company or agency on a job lead can 
        always be changed later.<h5>Reports</h5>
        <p><span class="propertitle">Job Search Plus</span> features 
              two reports which can be generated based on a variety of options.<ul>
                <li>Lead Detail Report - This is a profile report showing all of 
                the information for a specific lead in an easily accessible 
                format. This includes the full company and contact 
                information and all activity on the lead.</li>
                <li>Lead Summary Report - This report is  more compact and 
                shows basic details of a group of leads with the activity 
                history for each one. </li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                
                <p>There are a few ways that you can access these reports.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can select either of the reports from the ribbon menu. 
          This will open the Report Options dialog where you can choose the

          criteria.</li>
          <li>A detail report for an individual lead can be run from the Leads 
          Search List form by clicking on the 
          <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Print Lead</span> button at the bottom of

        <h4>Search Options Screen</h4>
                
        <p>The Search Options screen is used by the Leads List screen and both 
        reports in order to select specific leads for display.</p>
                
        <div class="fltcenter">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/015-ReportOptions.jpg" width="438" height="444">
        <p>The Search Options screen enables very specific selections of leads for reporting or display.</p>
        </div>
                
        <p>The default setting of the screen is to show all active leads. 
        In the example above, you can see where the settings for active, 
        full-time jobs are specified. The settings on the screen are 
        cumulative so all settings that are specified will be applied to the 
        lead selection once <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Done</span> 
        is clicked at the bottom of the screen. The checkboxes on the left 
        of the screen enable the fields next to them so that they can be set as 
        needed. Unchecking these&nbsp; fields prevents those options from 
        being considered in the selection. </p>
                
        <h4>Backup and Restore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h4>
        <p>It's important to backup your data every so often to protect it 
        against accidental deletions. Since Job Search Plus is stored under 
        your My Documents directory, you can copy the entire directory to 
        another disk if you like. For your convenience, the program also 
        has a full backup and restore system which will help you copy your data 
        file to another location or restore a previous backup.<p>&nbsp;<p>

        <div class="fltcenter">
        <a title="Click for full-size view." target="_blank" href="../Graphics/jsplus/019-Backup.jpg">
        <img border="0" src="../Graphics/jsplus/019-Backup-small.jpg" width="300" height="228"></a>
        </div>

        &nbsp;<p>To start, select the Backup / Restore icon from the menu ribbon. This will 
        open the Database Backup and Restore screen. This form will tell 
        you when the last backup was completed and if a backup is recommended. 
        The system recommends a backup approximately every five days but you can 
        run the backup as often as you like.</p>
        <p>If you select Backup as an 
        action, the program will require you to enter a folder where the backup 
        will be stored. The file name is supplied automatically. 
        Clicking the Browse button to the right of the location field will bring 
        up a folder selection dialog with which you can select a folder. For a Restore operation, you need to select an actual 
        file to be restored and the Browse button will open an Open File dialog 
        you can use to select that file.<p>The program runs certain checks 
        before carrying out these actions. It will verify if a backup 
        already exists at the location you've selected and ask if that backup 
        can be overwritten. If you select a file to restore, the program 
        will verify that the file exists and that it's a valid database file to 
        be used with Job Search Plus. If any of these checks fail, the 
        program will notify you and you can select a different file or location.<p class="note">
        In order to ensure the successful backup of your data, it is necessary 
        to close all connections with the data file that's being used. A 
        restart of the program is used to ensure that this is done.<p>In 
        addition to active backups, the system keeps track of when the last 
        backup was completed and will occasionally prompt you at startup. After more than a week without 
        a backup, the program will remind you once every three days until one is 
        performed.<p>Job Search Plus is also programmed to protect your data by 
        detecting if the database has been damaged in any way. If it finds 
        corruption in the file, the program will copy the existing data file to 
        a recovery file within the program directory before creating a new data 
        file so you can continue to use the program. If this happens, a 
        message will be displayed on startup, notifying you of the problem and 
        the address to e-mail for support and resolution. In this event, 
        there is no guarantee that a damaged file can be restored so, again, please be sure 
        to backup your data often.<p>&nbsp;<p>If you have any issues with 
        Job Search Plus, 
        please report them by e-mail to <a href="mailto:software@drewslair.com">
