        is offered free of any warranty or guarantee of fitness for a particular 
        purpose.&nbsp; Advice or resources found here are implemented at the user&#39;s own

    <h4>
        Privacy</h4>
    <p>
        ComeauSoftware.com and it&#39;s administrator(s) recognize that the privacy of your 
        personal information is important. The following sections detail what types of 
        information we receive and collect when you use and visit ComeauSoftware.com, and how 
        your information is protected.</p>
    <h5>
        Privileged and Ethical Use of Information</h5>
    <p>
        Unless explicitly stated, ComeauSoftware.com does not collect personally identifying 
        information on its visitors more specific than the IP (internet protocol) 
        address of the machine being used to access the site.&nbsp; Information that is 
        collected will not be sold to third parties or used for the purpose of 
        unsolicited advertisements.</p>
    <h5>
        Log Files</h5>
    <p 
        class="style2">
        Like most other websites, ComeauSoftware.com collects and uses the data contained in<span 
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a 
            href="http://www.ComeauSoftware.com/desk/access/general/analysis.shtml" 
            style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ">log files</a><span 
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>which record visits to the site and 
        what content is accessed. The information in the log files include your IP 
        (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or 
        Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer 
        or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited 
        throughout our site.&nbsp; This information is used solely to monitor site 
        traffic, gauge the effectiveness of content and monitor the site for downtime 
        and other technical problems.</p>
    <h5>
        Cookies and Web Beacons</h5>
    <p>
        ComeauSoftware.com might use cookies to store information, such as your personal 
        preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup 
        once in your visit, or the ability to login to site features, such as forums.</p>
    <p>
        ComeauSoftware.com also uses third party advertisements to financially support the 
        site. Some of these advertisers might use technology such as cookies and web 
        beacons when they advertise on ComeauSoftware.com, which will also send these 
        advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information 
        including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit the site, 
        and in some cases, whether you have components such as Flash installed. This is generally used for 
        geo-targeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, 
        for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as 
        showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
    <h5>
        DoubleClick DART cookies</h5>
    <p 
        class="style2">
        ComeauSoftware.com might also use DART cookies for serving ads through Google’s 
        DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the 
        web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google 
        AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and 
        your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted 
        based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing 
        sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when 
        viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non 
        personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information 
        about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, 
        social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can 
        opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting<a 
            href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" 
            style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); " target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party 
        cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as 
        Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact 
        with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to 
        login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
    <p>
        Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising 
        program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit 
        a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>
