        You've probably heard people talk about how we're living in the Information Age 
        with an emphasis on how much information there is to process from all different 
        directions. This is certainly true and it can be a challenge for the 
        average person, especially if they were born even a few decades ago before there 
        was a personal computer in almost every home and when most people were 
        happy with a few local channels on their TV.</p>

        The flip side of living in the information cloud is that it's never been easier 
        for you to find information and learn virtually any subject. Universities 
        no longer have a monopoly on education and people are no longer dependent on 
        their local library, bookstore or media outlets for materials. 
        Conversely, I never imagined when I was growing up in a small town in the 1970s 
        that, one day, I could be a
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Access-for-Beginners-ebook/dp/B0061RK6VO">
        published author</a> without going through the trials of manuscript submissions, 
        editorial reviews and multiple rejections ... but here we are.
    </p>
    <h5>
        What does it take?</h5>
    <p>
        As I indicated in <a href="201206190957.aspx">Part One</a>, a career in software development doesn't require a 
        large amount of formal education or a long list of certifications. Neither of 
        these are bad things and the more paper you have to your name, the easier it is 
        to get your foot in the door with various companies. Some people also find it 
        easier to start out learning in a classroom rather than on their own. The 
        company and collaboration with other students can be very helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, though, the person who commits themselves to a programming career 
        will be continuously learning and will need to be flexible in the way they can 
        learn new languages and technologies.&nbsp;Seminars and classes can be 
        expensive and limited in the information that they can impart. A single 
        programming language can include a huge amout of information that no one person 
        can carry around in their head. For the new programmer, books and reference websites 
        will become constant, indispensible companions.</p>

        </div>    
            
            <p>Beyond the initial introduction to any programming technology, the most 
        important part of becoming a software developer is practice and more <em>
        practice</em>. I'm talking about the hundreds of hours of your own time that you 
        will gladly, even eagerly, spend at your computer trying out new things with your 
        chosen languages just because you know that certain tasks must be achievable. 
        Really good programmers will attack programming challenges with the same passion 
        they show for developing their character in World of Warcraft, collecting 
        baseball stats, gourmet coooking or any other favorite pasttime you can think 
        of. They will do it simply because they enjoy it. That's the mindset that is 
        necessary to be able to quickly pick up the new languages and technologies that 
        are constantly being released and adopted by potential employers and customers. 
        It's the quality that enables a seasoned programmer to go from having once heard 
        of a technology to being able to discuss it intelligently in the time it takes 
        to prepare for an interview.</p>
    <p>
        Still, everyone starts somewhere and I still remember the time 
        when I barely 
        knew how to work with a computer. Instead of just giving you a dry 
        list of resources or steps to follow, let me start by telling you how I did it.</p>
    <h5>
        One Programmer&#39;s Story</h5>
    <p>
        My first programming experience was in high 
        school back in the mid-80s. At that time, 
        there was never much room in what computer classes were available but I did 
        find one of the old TRS-80 computers sitting unused in one of my classes where I 
        had a lot of spare time. Those computers had the old BASIC language 
        hardwired into them and there were manuals available. That's all it took 
        to get me started. Some of the other students thought I was kind of 
        strange and even took to hiding the books from me but I managed to learn enough 
        to get hooked and gain an edge in the college programming courses that came 
        later.</p>
    
        <div class="fltright">

        <img title="Photo courtesty of Easterbilby (Flickr.com)"  width="200" border="0" 
            src="../Graphics/Content/011-TRS80.jpg" /></a>
            </div>
            
            <p>In college, I used a later version of BASIC called 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a> (still primitive by 
        today's standards), better computers and more encouragement. I remember 
        the hours I spent after school trying out new things and developing my own 
        projects. At one point, a teacher handed me a project and said with a chuckle 
        &quot;Well, maybe this will keep you busy for a day.&quot;</p>
    <p>
        Not having a computer at home and with computers being fairly expensive at that 
        time, I actually put the programming aside for several years as I focused on the 
        early part of my career.&nbsp;This wasn't a completely bad thing. It's good for 
        a programmer to have experience in another field to provide a user perspective 
        when developing programs. I did the occasional bit of programming throughout 
        the 90s but my real return to my programming ways came in 1997 when I started 
        playing around with 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drewslair.com/desk/access/beginners/intro.shtml">Microsoft Access</a>. 
        I was looking to automate some things I was doing at work and managed to get 
        hold of Access 97 which was considered one 
        of the best versions released. I learned a lot about relational database design 
        and then started working with 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drewslair.com/desk/vba_intro/index.shtml">Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</a>, the version 
        of BASIC behind all the Microsoft Office applications, including Access. Once I 
        saw what I could do with that, there was no going back. Within a 
        year or two, other people also saw what I could do and I was designing apps for 
        other departments ... then other facilities.</p>
    <p>
        In 2002, I took a little detour into technical writing with another company and 
        then helpdesk support for hardware and software. It's also good for programmers 
        to have exposure to other areas of I.T. and I needed to get over a hardware 
        phobia I was holding on to. This time, I kept programming. In 2000, I'd 
        started <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drewslair.com">Drewslair.com</a>, my first website, eventually stopped depending on 
        the FrontPage software I was using to maintain it and learned how to write HTML code. In 2002, it morphed into a 
        professsional site and I started posting samples of my work. The next 
        year, I started <em>writing</em> about Microsoft Access and other subjects and 
        publishing the articles on Drewslair.com. Google advertisements helped 
        the site pay for itself but mostly I was doing this on my own dime because it 
        was what I needed to do both personally and professionally.</p>
    <p>
        In 2005, the work I'd done with Microsoft Access / VBA and was able to 
        demonstrate on Drewslair.com was 
        instrumental in landing me a job as a Production Support Engineer where I 
        tracked down problems with custom software by examining the code and the data 
        involved. That led to my first official programming position a couple 
        years later and both jobs provided me with a lot more programming experience 
        with tools I hadn't used before. I've continued learning ever since. 
        </p>
    <p>
        In 2010, an interviewer asked me if I could design an online purchasing 
        application for his company within a generous time frame. Despite my work 
        with Drewslair.com, I'd been fixated on Windows desktop applications when it 
        came to what I considered actual programming but I'd experimented with 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asp.net/get-started">ASP.NET</a> so I 
        said &quot;Sure!&quot; and proceded to learn what I needed to know to design the application. </p>
    <p>
        After being laid off from that job, the experience I gained there helped qualify 
        me for my last outside job which was almost pure website application design for a local 
        company with ASP.NET. Now ASP.NET itself is not a language but a style of 
        website design that combines HTML web pages with either the 
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh388568.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Basic.NET</a> or 
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh388566.aspx" target="_blank">C#</a> language, depending on the programmer's preference. I was accustomed to 
        VB.NET and the company did everything in C# but said they'd be okay with me progrmaming in VB.NET. 
        I learned to do everything in C# and am now very comfortable with the language which is 
        good because it's the more popular of the two.</p>
    <p>
        So that's the story of my career up to the present which finds me using all 
        the experience I've gained so far in the production of this website. It hasn't been a 
        perfect run but I'm pretty much where I need to be given the overall 
        circumstances of my life and I feel that's a good place.</p>
    <h5>
        Conclusion </h5>
    <p>
        If I had to sum up the 
        most important quality that a professional programmer needs in order to succeed, 
        I'd say it's <em>initiative</em>, meaning the willingness to do something you 
        haven't done before without waiting for someone else's permission or direction. 
        That quality depends on a good supply of confidence and sound judgement. 
        It's been my biggest strength over the years and my biggest regrets are about 
        when I didn't show enough of it. Just as I've been willing to take risks 
        and try new things, there are also times in the above story when I've waited for 
        circumstances to push me into learning new things and shied away from subjects I 
        didn't want to deal with at the time. I've regretted those decisions later when 
        I didn't have the skills I needed at a crucial point.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Aside from the willingness to learn, initiative is also what makes the 
        difference betwen a programmer who is willing to ask the unpopular questions if 
        it means saving a project or to suggest a new project that will benefit the 
        company or client and the programmer who sits back with the crowd and lets 
        someone else take the risk. 
        In a constantly changing field of technology, it's the quality that enables 
        someone to keep moving and stay current instead of being left behind when their 
        skillset becomes obsolete.</p>
    <p>
        There are more opportunities out there to learn than one programmer could ever 
        follow up on and fewer excuses than ever not to reach out and grab some of them. 
        Take whatever inspiration you can from my story and know that given the right 
        combination of talent and drive, you can do even more. </p>
