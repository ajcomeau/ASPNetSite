        Ask a lot of people about the requirements to be a computer programmer or 
        software developer and they'll 
        probably start talking about computer science degrees and years of formal 
        training. Those things don't hurt but they're not strictly necessary, either.&nbsp;I 
        personally do not have a degree aside from the accounting diploma I earned 
        from a local business college many years ago. I am certified by Microsoft in 
        Windows application development, a certification I earned through self-directed 
        and cooperative study with a few co-workers. Most of what I know about 
        programming is through self-teaching and experience. Nevertheless, with my 
        current experience, all I have to do is post 
        <a href="../Pages/comeau-resume.aspx" target="_blank">my resume</a> and send copies to a couple of 
        recruiters and my phone starts ringing. It's about the demonstrated 
        skills, not the paper.</p>

            <p>It still doesn't happen overnight. Employers typically look for at least three 
        years of experience with specific programming technologies, five is better, and 
        they'll be looking for experience with a collection of technologies because 
        developers often have need of three or four on any one project. I can 
        quickly name four that I've used just in designing this site. If you 
        want to know the typical requirements for a programming position, I recommend a 
        quick search of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monster.com">Monster.com</a> or 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.careerbuilder.com">CareerBuilder.com</a> for terms like &quot;software 
        developer&quot; or &quot;computer programmer&quot;. (You should specify &quot;computer&quot; 
        or you'll get a lot of listings for CNC programmers which are something 
        completely different.) I use variations on these terms interchangeably 
        here although they can mean different things. One is very often, but not 
        always, the other.</p>
    <p>
        The job listing search is an 
        occasional exercise I recommend even for experienced and employed programmers because the popular technologies are constantly changing.&nbsp;Of course, even 
        employed software developers often find themselves checking these sites because 
        the annual turnover for programmers can be rather high. A survey by 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.compdatasurveys.com/">CompData</a> placed the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://compforce.typepad.com/compensation_force/2009/03/2008-turnover-rates-by-industry.html">
        2008 turnover</a> for high-tech employees at over 20%. 
        Bear in mind that the economic meltdown didn't become apparent until late in 
        2008 and over 17% of the turnover was voluntary, meaning the employees decided on their 
        own to jump ship.&nbsp;The
        <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.ianuy.com/2010/09/26/on-the-high-turnover-rate-of-software-developers-or-how-to-retain-your-best-software-developers-and-programmers/">
        reasons are numerous</a> and some might seem trival to someone who is accustomed 
        to holding on to a job at any cost but we are talking about highly-skilled 
        technology workers in a high-demand field. When I say high-demand, I'm 
        talking about the demands <strong><em>on</em></strong> the 
        employee as well as <em><strong>for</strong></em> new employees. Again, this 
        may seem surprising to someone in a more physical job like construction or 
        maintenance but it's true.&nbsp;Unfortunately, that truth has not caught on with the 
        companies that are failing to keep the valuable employees who can take <em>six months</em> to train and 
        be truly productive in any one 
        position. </p>

        More than Writing Code</h5>

            <p>The most important skills for a qualified developer probably won't be 
        clear from the average job description which will often be written by an HR 
        person with a fondness for abbreviations and product names they can list without 
        having to understand. Those skills are basic problem solving and a talent for system 
        analysis; the skills that enable a person to accept a project from a manager or 
        customer with fairly vague requirements and then to break that assignment down 
        into more specific requirements by asking the right questions, tackle each one 
        and design a solution that will not only meet the entire specification but will 
        anticipate the needs that the manager or customer hasn't mentioned but expects 
        anyway. You might remember your teachers trying to show you the problem solving 
        part when you were faced with those word problems that we all hated so much on 
        tests. I remember preferring the nice, quick True / False questions but it 
        turns out that real life is often about as far from that kind of question as you 
        can get. The rest can either be taught only by experience or can't be 
        taught at all. Some of it comes down to empathy for the user's situation 
        and some of it comes down to simple aptitude and 
        talent for a specific field. For this reason, the need to find truly 
        qualified and talented software developers leads to some very unusual job 
        interviews.</p>
    <p>
        Notice that I haven't talked about writing code?&nbsp;That's because as much as 
        programmers naturally love to write code and as important as quality code is, 
        it's one of the last steps in the process and one of the easiest. Software 
        development is an engineering field.&nbsp;This means that it's about much more than 
        assembling a product. As I stated above, it starts with making sure that the 
        project requirements are complete and often doesn't end until the software has 
        been deployed and the users are providing feedback.&nbsp;That's called the 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Development_Life_Cycle" 
            target="_blank">Software 
        Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</a>, another acronym you'll see on Monster.com. Also, 
        as engineers, programmers and software developers who want to pay the bills 
        rarely get to play with the fun theoretical code problems unless it's on their 
        own time.&nbsp;Usually,&nbsp;they will be responding to real-world business needs in 
        various fields from healthcare to banking and dealing with all the regulations, 
        issues, problems and even politics that are 
        raised in those fields, including the knowledge that their work ultimately 
        impacts the business customers. Even if a developer is designing computer games, 
        he or she still works for a business with a financial bottom line, deadlines to 
        meet and customers to satisfy.</p>
    <h5>
        Why do it?</h5>
    <p>
        All of this is said not to scare you away from programming or software 
        development but to make you aware of the realities of such a career.&nbsp;That's part 
        of what I want to do with this site. Programming and software development are 
        about much more than sitting at a computer guzzling coffee and typing code late 
        into the night. While it's possible to work your way into the field without a 
        four-year degree, 
        it's not a cakewalk, especially since it's not one of those jobs that you can 
        just leave behind at the end of the day. This type of intellectually 
        intense and sometimes high pressure work will follow you home at night, even if 
        you are not cursed with carrying a company cell phone.&nbsp;If you are the type 
        who actually enjoys solving complex problems and designing systems, it's not an 
        activity that your brain can just switch on and off.</p>

            </div>

     <p>In a perverse way, that's why I do it. I started my career in the 8 to 5 
        jobs filled with routine work that I could leave behind at the end of the day 
        and the only challenge was in dealing with office politics or a control-freak 
        boss. For all the pressure, uncertainty and trials of a career in software 
        development, it's work that I love because I am using my 
        abilities to their fullest. I love the almost physical feeling when all the 
        neurons are firing and my brain is in full analysis mode. I get a rush 
        from watching a section of code work right for the first time, especially if 
        I've been wrestling with it for awhile. It's satsifying to watch a system 
        take shape and know that I have a hand in its creation.&nbsp;I do it simply 
        because my brain is wired in such a way that I delight in programming concepts 
        and it's what I get the most joy from doing. It's who I am.</p>
