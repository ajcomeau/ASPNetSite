    <p>In the <a href="201206252154.aspx">last chapter</a>, I talked about some 
of the current options when it comes to getting started in the programming 
field. I mentioned several development tools that you can get familiar with to 
decide what path you want to take as a software developer but getting started is 
only half the battle. As I said, the field is constantly changing and 
with so much evolving technology, it can be hard to keep up even if you're 
working with it every day. When planning a career, there's also a desire to have some 
idea of what things will look like five years down the road and where you should 
be in relation to them. That's harder to do in the I.T. world but there are some 
things that you can plan on and overall strategies that you can use to develop a 
solid foundation of knowledge.</p>
<h5>So What is Coming?</h5>
    <div class="fltright"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/katerha/"><img alt="Crystal Ball"

    </div>
        
        I can't see five years into the future, especially in the I.T. field, but 
there are a few things I can predict from my experience over the last 20 and I 
offer them here for those who don't know which way to turn with all of the 
choices&nbsp;out there.</p>
<p>First, understand that even though new products and new versions of existing 
products are released every couple of years, individual companies are not that quick 
    to upgrade. Upgrading to a new development tool is expensive 
even for a small company because of licensing, training and the effort it takes 
to upgrade existing projects. There has to be a really good reason to do it and 
often, there just isn't. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I saw a company that still had much of its code in Visual 
Basic 6.0 which was released in 1998. Microsoft's support for VB 6.0 ended in 
2008. Yet, this company was still using it for software that ran much of its 
core business. Other relatively ancient languages like COBOL and FORTRAN hang 
on because of the sheer volume of code written in them and the expense and risk 
of rewriting it. </p>
<p>Another variant of the VB language, 
    <a href="http://www.drewslair.com/desk/vba_intro/index.shtml" target="_blank">Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</a>, hangs on 
because it's available as part of Microsoft Office and is used by many non-I.T. 
power users who have learned enough about programming to create the 
necessary apps that their I.T. departments don't have time to provide. The irony is that when those users leave the organization, I.T. will 
often end up supporting those rogue applications and there will be some need for 
people who know VBA.</p>
<p>So, many of the new products coming out right now and even the products that 
have been out for a few years will still be in use and relevant five years from 
now. Your hard-earned knowledge will not become obsolete overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Databases will still be around for a lot more than five years. It's hard to 
get away from the need to store data somewhere and the major players like MySQL, 
SQL Server, Oracle and others don't seem to be in much danger. Learning about 
relational database principles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735626014/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735626014&linkCode=as2&tag=drewslaircom-20">stored procedure programming</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=drewslaircom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0735626014" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 and the intricacies 
of communication between software and database will serve you well for a long, 
long time.</p>

<div class="fltleft">
    <img alt="" width="200" border="0" src="../Graphics/Content/018-http.jpg" />
</div>    
    <p>Barring something completely catastrophic, the World Wide Web will still be 
here and, considering how long it took to move 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_4#Version_history_of_the_standard" 
            target="_blank">from HTML 4 to HTML 5</a>, it's a 
fair bet that both will still be around. Languages like PHP and Javascript 
and technologies like 
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596802447/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596802447&linkCode=as2&tag=drewslaircom-20" 
            target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=drewslaircom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596802447" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 (CSS) will still be here and if any of them happens to be on 
the decline by then, whatever replaces them will probably look very familiar to 
anyone who knows them well. Learning the various ways to create and publish a 
website both to your own organization's intranet and on the public Web through a 
hosting service is also a good move.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/" target="_blank">C programming language</a> will still be 
    around and influencing other 
languages. Microsoft&#39;s C# is easy enough to learn and studying it will introduce you to both 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430225491/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430225491&linkCode=as2&tag=drewslaircom-20" 
        target="_blank">C syntax and Microsoft's .NET</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=drewslaircom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1430225491" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 framework so that's a good place to start.</p>
<p>Smartphones and other mobile devices are here to stay and will only 
get smarter. Google has a pretty good thing going with the Android operating 
system and no reason to let it go so if you want to do smartphone apps, there's 
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html" target="_blank">a lot of support</a> for learning that technology right now. The programming 
principles that you pick up will continue to serve you in whatever comes next.</p>
<p>In your spare time, it's good to learn what you can about 
    <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/home.aspx" target="_blank">networking and 
hardware</a>. It's another part of the perspective that you need to write reliable 
and useful programs that will work in the environments where they're needed. </p>
<p>So, just dive right in and explore because all the things you learn today 
will be around long enough to profit from and whatever else comes along in the 
next few years will just extend your horizons.</p>
<h5>Look for the Patterns</h5>

<div class="fltright">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/georgscholz/">
    <img alt="" title="Photo courtesty of Georg Scholz (Flickr.com)" border="0" width="200" src="../Graphics/Content/019-pattern.jpg" />
</a>
</div>
    <p>When looking at the products that I recommended and any others that you come 
across, look at them in terms of the larger technologies they represent. 
        Microsoft Visual Studio is only one IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are 
many others for different languages but they all have similarities like 
debugging tools, various levels of statement auto-completion (intellisense), 
project explorer windows, etc.. It's the same with database systems; various 
packages have different featues but most popular ones implement the same 
principles in different ways. Whether I'm looking at SQL Server, MySQL or 
        Microsoft Access, I'm going to be looking at how to design and relate the tables and how 
to transfer data in and out of the system. When you start getting a feel for the 
commonalities between different software packages, you will know how they 
measure up against each other and you will also know what to expect when picking 
up a new piece of software that you've never worked with before.</p>
<p>Also, pay special attention to concepts like 
    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283878" target="_blank">data normalization</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430235306/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430235306&linkCode=as2&tag=drewslaircom-20" 
        target="_blank">object oriented programming</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=drewslaircom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1430235306" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 that work across different systems. Chances are, 
when sitting in an interview for a programming job, you will be asked about some 
of these high-level concepts in order to gauge your experience as a developer 
and your ability to write reliable programs.</p>
<p>It's essential to get exposure to different products and to avoid getting 
religious about the merits of one particular package. One thought that's stuck 
with me over the years is that a programmer is someone who can use the necessary 
tools to get the job done. There is no single programming tool that fits all 
situations and the more tools you work with, the more you will be prepared to 
learn new ones as needed and stay employed. </p>
<h5>Throw Away the Crutches</h5>

<div class="fltleft">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamkr/">
    <img alt="" border="0" width="200" title="Photo courtesy of AdamKR (Flickr.com)" src="../Graphics/Content/020-runner.jpg" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Some development software includes sample code or &quot;code snippets&quot; that you 
can drop into your program to make something work. It's also common to find 
sample code on the Internet that the authors generously invite you to use in 
your own programs. It's a rule of mine that I don&#39;t use code like this without 
        understanding how it works. This is important both 
for your education and for the security of your programs. You cannot claim 
ownership of a project that is filled with 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box" target="_blank">black boxes</a> or code that just works 
without you knowing why. </p>
<p>Query builders and statement auto-completion are also great but make every effort to 
    understand the programming syntax itself so you&#39;re not dependent on them. 
    <a href="http://www.drewslair.com/desk/access/beginners/sqlbasics.shtml" 
        target="_blank">SQL (Structured Query Language)</a>, the scripting language used in many databases, 
is not hard to learn and there are some queries that must be written manually. 
When writing T-SQL stored procedures, you'll still be working manually for the 
most part. When it comes to optimizing database queries and tracking down those 
obscure bugs that cause errors, you'll be glad for the understanding that comes 
with knowing the language.</p>
<h5>Expand Your Knowledge</h5>
<p>In the programming world, comfort equals complacency. Remember that no matter 
how much you know, there is always more to learn. The technology is always 
changing and if you want to stay current, you have to keep up with it. If you 
want to provide the best solutions to your employer, your clients or whatever 
problems you encounter yourself, you need to have a wide base of knowledge in 
order to make the best recommendations. There is no one tool that is appropriate 
in every situation. As I suggested in <a href="201206190957.aspx">an earlier chapter</a>, take the time once in 
awhile to scan the job postings on the Internet to see what's in demand. If you 
see something you don't recognize or know, add it to the list.</p>

<div class="fltright"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=020161622X&linkCode=as2&tag=drewslaircom-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=020161622X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=drewslaircom-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=drewslaircom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=020161622X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></div>

<p>Remember that there will always be people who know more than you. Seek these 
people out and learn from them whether it's through participation in Internet 
forums, local user groups or a new project that stretches your abilities. Being 
the most computer-literate person in the office can be fun but it can also lead 
to complacency. As long as you're willing to learn, you never have to be afraid 
to admit what you don't know. On the other side, every day that you put off 
learning increases the chance that the knowledge won't be there when you need 
it. That time might come when you have to admit to not knowing something that 
you realize you should have taken the time to learn a year ago or when you don't 
meet the requirements for that great job you really want and you know you could 
have if you'd been more attentive. This is a lesson I've learned the hard way 
more than once. </p>

<p>In their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=020161622X&linkCode=as2&tag=drewslaircom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=020161622X" 
 alt="" style="border:none !important; !important;" target="_blank"> The Pragmmatic Programmer </a>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas use the 
investment portfolio as a metaphor for a person's collection of knowledge and 
experience. The development of your 'knowledge portfolio' is essential to your 
success as a developer. Adding to your portfolio 
nowadays often requires little more than an investment of your time. The state 
of your portfolio will affect such things as your salary, the respect your get 
at work and even where you are able to live.</p>
<p>So get out there and have fun learning! </p>
